Hello World compliation
This is the "Phyton Code Example Handbook" from FreeCodeAcademy,
mixed in with my own additions and differences to learn python and coding as I go along.

The handbook can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-code-example-handbook/

Main is the 'Master' program that all other programs run from, listing all available examples from the Handbook
